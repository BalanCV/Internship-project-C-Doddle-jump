# Internship Project: C++ Doodle Jump
Doodle jump clone made using C++ for an internship project using a simple provided framework that is based on sdl2.
Framework code will not be included here as it was provided by the company.

Program functions based on requirements:

Game loop: Player can move left and right and will jump when landing on platform. Score is added upon progress. Can collect coins.

Player: Can shoot aimed projectile with l-click and auto-shoot temporary with r-click if it has 20 coins. Can move on the sides of the screen to appear on the opposite side. Loses a life when touching the bottom of the screen. Spawns on the lowest platform on life loss.

Enemies: Attached to platforms, dissappear when shot or when player jumps on their head. Any other collision will remove a life and reset.

Platforms: Spawned randomly, distanced between each-other.
